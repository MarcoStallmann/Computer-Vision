# Computer Vision and Convolutional NeuralNetworks

*by Marco Stallmann*

In this Repository I am working with ConvNets on real-world data and learn about techniques that can be used to improve the ConvNet performance, particularly when doing image classification!


## [Digit recognizer](https://github.com/MarcoStallmann/Computer-Vision-and-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/blob/main/Digit%20recognizer%20analysis/digit-recognizer-comparative-analysis.ipynb)

In the Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition, the goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images (MNIST). Kaggle has curated a set of tutorial-style kernels which cover everything from regression to neural networks and encourages to experiment with different algorithms and are therefore incorporated into this Notebook with reference.


## [Transfer Learning with Hourses or Humans Dataset](https://github.com/MarcoStallmann/Computer-Vision-and-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/blob/main/Transfer%20Learning%20with%20Horse%20or%20Human%20Dataset/Transfer_Learning_with_Horses_or_Humans_Dataset.ipynb)

Here we are going to use Transfer Learning which utilizes an already trained network to help us solve a similar problem to the one it was originally trained to solve.

 
## [Using CNN's with the Cats vs Dogs Dataset](https://github.com/MarcoStallmann/Convolutional-Neural-Networks/blob/main/Using%20CNN's%20with%20the%20Cats%20vs%20Dogs%20Dataset/using-cnn-s-with-the-cats-vs-dogs-dataset.ipynb)

In this Notebook the famous `Cats vs Dogs` dataset is used to train a model that can classify images of dogs from images of cats. For this, a Convolutional Neural Network in Tensorflow is created and Keras' image preprocessing utilities are leveraged.
